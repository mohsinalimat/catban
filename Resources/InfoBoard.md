# Board

## About
A board represents the current state of one of your projects; a project can be anything:
- A milestone in your job
- Your thesis
- The wedding of your best friend
- Dinner
- A shopping list
- Your life
- etc

## Rationale
It is important to keep track of every little detail in your project, each one of those details contributes to project and could define wether the it succeeds of fails.

### Cards
The first step is dividing the project into small *components* or tasks as atomic as possible. To represent these components we use _cards_.

Let's assume we want to plan dinner. We can have components for every ingredient necessary in order not to forget to buy it and we can also have components for the cooking steps of every one of the meals, the cards could look like:

**Ingredient**
150 grams of gluten free flour

**Ingredient**
300 grams of cheddar

**Ingredient**
200 grams of salami

**Ingredient**
1 cup of milk

**Ingredient**
1 cup of water

**Ingredient**
1 spoon of butter without salt

**Cooking**
Mix water, milk and flour on the blender softly for about 30 seconds

**Cooking**
Let the blended mixture rest on the fridge for about 2 hours

### Columns
The second step is to organise your cards into _columns_. Each column represents the state of the cards in it. Originally **Kanban** consists of 3 columns: _To do_, _In progress_, _Done_. You can use the standard setup or create the setup that best fits your needs.

**To do**
Every card should be initiated on this column to represent all the components of the project and specially to demonstrate what is needed to be done. If you realise there is a task that doesn't have a card assigned to it you can create it at any time.

**In progress**
As soon as you start working on a component you should reflect it on the columns by moving its card from _To do_ to _In progress_.

**Done**
If you finish a task you should move its card to this column so you can have a clear view of how much of the project is already finished.
