Kanban board
Do more with less; human interface for management.

Catban uses a minimalistic interface to manage your projects and helps you focus on getting things done.

■ What is Kanban?
Kanban is a scheduling and managing system developed in Japan to improve manufacturing and production efficiency; it was first implemented in a vehicles factory and recently has been widely used in Software Engineering to manage and organise projects and products but its concept is very straightforward and basic that can be easily applied in any field and to any kind of project.
Is just like having cards on a wall.

■ Concept
Divide a project in small tasks. The smaller the tasks the easier it is to accomplish it and get feedback, also it becomes easier to understand how the project is constituted.
As Buckminster Fuller said: you can't really understand a problem until you understand each one of its components.

Once the project is divided into tasks you create a Board. This board is the abstraction of a canvas and is the representation of the whole project. Nothing outside the project should interfere with the board and this board should no try to handle anything outside the project.

Once the board is ready you create 3 Columns that will represent the stage in which every one of the tasks is.

Every task begins in the left most column, representing everything needed to fulfil the project. When this column is empty you can consider the project as finished.

The middle column represents those tasks you and all the participants of the project are currently working on; whenever this column is empty it can be said that there is no current progress on the project.

The right most column represents what is already completed; ideally every task ends here.

When the columns are defined you create a Card for each task; each card is just the representation of a simple idea, think of a post-it; write in each one of these cards the smallest amount of information needed to fulfil the task but enough so there can't be doubts about it.
